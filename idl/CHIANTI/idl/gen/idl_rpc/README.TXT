IDL Version 5.0
------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains information related to using IDL
in conjunction with other programming languages. It contains
the following subdirectories:

  - callable
    The callable directory contains information and files
    necessary to create applications (in languages other
    than IDL) that call IDL as a library.

  - rpc
    The rpc directory contains information and files
    necessary to use IDL as a server for Remote Procedure
    Calls (RPCs). Note that RPCs are only available under
    Unix.

  - sharelib
    The sharelib directory contains information and files
    necessary to create applications (in languages other
    than IDL) which are then used by IDL either via LINKIMAGE
    or CALL_EXTERNAL.

  - widstub
    The widstub directory contains information and files
    necessary to create widgets (using the IDL function
    WIDGET_STUB) that can be used by IDL.
