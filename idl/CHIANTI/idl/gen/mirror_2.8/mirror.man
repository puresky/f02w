mirror \- mirror packages on remote sites
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mirror
.B [flags] \-g\fIsite\fP:\fIpathname\fP
.br
.B mirror
.B [flags] [config-files]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mirror
is a package written in Perl that uses the ftp protocol
to duplicate a directory hierarchy between the machine it is run on and
a remote host.  It avoids copying files unnecessarily by comparing the
file time-stamps and sizes before transferring.  Amongst other things, it
can optionally compress, gzip, and split files.
.LP
It was written for use by archive maintainers but can be
used by anyone wanting to transfer a lot of files via ftp.
.LP
Regardless of how it is called,
.B mirror
always performs the same basic steps.  It connects to the remote site,
internally builds a directory listing of the local target directory, builds one
for the remote directory, compares them, creates any subdirectories
required, transfers the appropriate files (setting their time-stamps to
match those on the remote site), creates any symbolic links, removes any
unnecessary objects and finally drops the connection.
.LP
.B Mirror
can handle symbolic links but not ordinary links.  It does not
duplicate owner or group information.  If you require any of these
options, use
.BR rdist (1)
instead.
.LP
.B Mirror
is called in one of two ways shown in the synopsis above.
.LP
The first method is used to retrieve a remote directory into the
current directory.  If you are mirroring a directory, it would be best
to end the pathname in a slash ('/') so the remote recursive listing
is smaller or use the
.B \-r
flag to suppress recursion (see
.B \-g
below).  The
.B mirror.defaults
file is not used.
.LP
In the second method given in the synopsis above,
a minimal number of arguments are required and
.B mirror
is controlled by the settings read from the configuration files (or
standard input).  If a file named
.B mirror.defaults
can be found in either the directory the
.B mirror
executable is in or in the
.B PERLLIB
path, then it is loaded first. This is used to
provide common defaults for all config-files.
.LP
.B Mirror
was written to mirror remote Un*x archives, but has grown (like topsy).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Enable debugging.  If this argument is given more than once, the
debugging level will increase.  Currently the maximum useful level is
four.
.TP
.BR \-p package
Only mirror the given package.  This option may be given multiple
times in which case all the given packages will be mirrored.  Without
this option, all packages will be mirrored.  Package is
a regexp matched against the package variable.
.TP
.BR \-R package
Similar to
.B \-p
but skips all packages until it reaches the given package.  Useful for
restarting failed mirror runs from where they left off.
.TP
.B \-n
Do nothing except compare local and remote directories, no file
transfers are done.  Sets debug level to two, so you are shown a
trace of what would be done.
.TP
.B \-F
Use temporary 
.B dbm
files for the information about files.  This is useful if you mirror a
very large directory.  See the variable
.IR use_files .
.TP
.BR \-g site\fB:\fPpath
Get all files on given site.  If path matches \ \ .*/.+\ \  then
it is the name of the directory and the last part is the
pattern of filenames to get.  If path matches \ \ .*/\ \  then
it is the name of a directory and all its contents are retrieved.
Otherwise path is the pattern to be used in '/'.  If you use
host:/fred, a full directory listing of / on the remote host will
be done.  If all you wanted was the contents of the directory /fred,
specify host:/fred/.
.TP
.B \-r
Equivalent to
.BI \-k recursive\fR=false\fP
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version details of mirror and exit.
.TP
.B \-T
Force the time stamps of any local files to be reset to be the same as
the remote files.  Normally only used when initialising a mirror area
using existing files contents.
.TP
.B \-U[\fRfilename\fP]
Record all uploads into the given filename.  Remember that mirror changes into
\fIlocal_dir\fP to do its work, so it should be a full pathname.  If no
parameter is given, it defaults to \`pwd\`/upload_log.day.month.year.
.TP
.BR \-k \fIkey\fP=value
Override any default key/value.
.TP
.B \-m
Equivalent to
.BR \-k \fImode_copy\fP=true
.TP
.B \-t
Equivalent to
.BR \-k \fItext_mode\fP=true
.TP
.B \-f
Equivalent to
.BR \-k \fIforce\fP=true
.TP
.BR \-s site
Equivalent to
.BR \-k \fIsite\fP=site
.TP
.BR \-u user
Equivalent to
.BR \-k \fIremote_user\fP=user
You are then prompted for a password, with echo turned off.  The
password is used to set
.IR remote_password .
.TP
.B \-L
Just generate a pretty printed version of the input and exit.
.TP
.B \-G
Get files from the remote machine.  The local and remote directories
have to be given on the command line.  (This option is no longer supported.)
.TP
.B \-P
Put files onto the remote machine.  The local and remote directories
have to be given on the command line.  (This option is no longer supported.)
.TP
.BR \-C file
Specify config-files.  Needed to give config-files with
.B \-P
and
.B \-G
options.  (This option is no longer supported.)
.LP
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
Configuration files are parsed as a series of statements.
Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash are ignored.  Each
statement is of the form
.PD 0
.IP
.IR keyword \fB=\fPvalue
.P
or
.IP
.IR keyword \fB+\fPvalue
.PD
.LP
You can add whitespace before the keyword and the equals/plus.
Everything immediately following the equals/plus is the value,
including any leading or trailing whitespace.  The equals version sets
the keyword to this value, while the plus version concatenates the value
onto the end of the default.
.LP
A statement can be continued over multiple lines by ending all lines
except the last, with the character ampersand ('&').  The line
following the ampersand, is appended to the current line with
all leading whitespace removed.
.LP
Here is a list of the keywords and their values with defaults
given inside square brackets.  Those options flagged with a star are
not yet implemented.
.LP
Although there are a lot of keywords that can be set, the built-in
defaults will handle most cases.  Normally only
.IR package ,
.IR site ,
.I remote_dir
and
.I local_dir
need to be set.

.LP
Each group of keywords defines how to mirror a particular package and
should begin with a unique
.I package
line.  The package name is used in report generation and by the
.B \-p
argument, so pick something mnemonic.  The minimum needed for each
package is the
.IR package ,
.IR site ,
.I remote_dir
and
.IR local_dir .
On finding a package line, all the default values are reset.
.LP
If the package name is
.BR defaults ,
then no site is contacted, but the default values given for any
keywords are changed.  Normally all the defaults are in the file
.B mirror.defaults
which will be automatically loaded before any package details.
.eG
# Sample mirror.defaults
package=defaults
	# The LOCAL hostname - if not the same as `hostname` returns
	# (I advertise the name src.doc.ic.ac.uk but the machine is
	#  really puffin.doc.ic.ac.uk.)
	hostname=src.doc.ic.ac.uk
	# Keep all local_dirs relative to here
	local_dir=/public/
	remote_password=ukuug-soft@doc.ic.ac.uk
.Ge
If the package is not
.BR defaults ,
then
.B mirror
will perform the following steps.  Unless an internal failure is
detected, any error will cause the current package to be skipped and
the next one tried.
.LP
If 
.B mirror
is not already connected to the site, it will disconnect from any site it
is already connected to and attempt to connect to the remote site's
.B ftp
daemon.  It will then login using the given remote username and password.  Once
connected,
.B mirror
turns on binary mode transfers.  Next it changes to the given local directory
and scans it to get the details of the local files that already exist.  If
necessary, the local directory will be created.  Once this is completed, the
remote directory is scanned in a similar fashion.
.B Mirror
does this by changing to the remote directory and running the ftp LIST
command, passing the
.I flags_recursive
options or
.I flags_nonrecursive
depending on the value of
.I recursive.
Alternatively a file containing the directory listing may be
retrieved.  Each remote pathname will have any specified mappings
performed on it to create a local pathname.  Then any checks specified
by the
.IR exclude_patt ,
.IR max_days ,
.I get_newer
and
.IR get_size_change
keywords are applied on names of files or symlinks.  Only 
.IR exclude_patt
checking is applied to directories.
.LP
The above creates a list of all required remote files and the local pathnames
to store them in.
.LP
Once the directory listing is completed, all required files are
fetched from the remote site into their local path names.  This is
done by retrieving the file into a temporary file in the target directory.
If required, the temporary file is compressed, gzip'ed or split (or
compressed or gzip'ed and then split).
The temporary file is renamed when the transfer is successful.
.SH FILESTORES
.LP
Mirror uses the remote directory listing to work out what files are
available.  Mirror was originally targetted connect to unix ftp daemons
using a standard
.I ls
command.  To use a unix host with a non-standard ls or a non unix host
it is necessary to set the \fIremote_fs\fP variable to match the kind
of directory listing that will be returned.  There is some interaction
between \fIremote_fs\fP and other variables in particular
\fIflags_recursive\fP, \fIrecurse_hard\fP and \fIget_size_change\fP.
The following sub sections show examples of the results of running the
ftp \fIdir\fP command on the various kinds of archive and
recommendations for related variables.  With some unusually setups
archive you may have to vary from the recommended variable setups.

.SH HINTS
.LP
On adding a new package, first check it out by turning on the
.B \-n
option.
.LP
If you are adding to an existing archive, then it is usually best to
force the time-stamps of the existing local files so time comparisons
with the remote files will work.
.LP
Try and keep all packages that are being retrieved from the same site
together.  That way
.B mirror
will only have to login once.
.LP
Remember that all regexp's are Perl regular expressions.
.LP
If the remote site contains symlinks that you want to "flatten out"
into the corresponding files, then do this by changing the flags passed
to the remote ls:
.PD 0
.IP
.IR flags_recursive \fB+\fPL
.P
or
.IP
.IR flags_nonrecursive \fB+\fPL
.PD
.LP
First test this by trying a
.B ls\ \-lRatL
on the remote site under the ftp
command to check whether the remote file-store has any symlink loops.
.LP
If you are mirroring a very large site that changes infrequently, add
\fImax_days\fP=7 to the settings after it is initially mirrored.  That
way mirror will only have to consider recent files when updating.  Then
once a week, or whenever necessary, call mirror with
\fB\-k\fP\fImax_days\fP=0 to force a full update.
.LP
If you don't want to compress anything from the remote site the
easiest way to do this is to set the \fIcompress_patt\fP to nothing.
.LP
If you want to run a command at the end of mirroring a package a
useful trick is to reset the \fImail_prog\fP variable to be the
program name and \fImail_to\fP to be the arguments.
.LP
For netware, dosftp, macos and VMS you should normally set remote_dir
to be the home directory of the remote ftp daemon.  Connect in
manually and before changing directory use the pwd command to find
where home is.  If you are only mirroring part of the tree then give
the full path name including this home directory at the start.
.LP
macos names can sometimes contain characters that make it hard to pass
them through un*x shells.  Since compressing files is done via a shell
it would be best to turn off compression with compress_patt=
.LP
macos files seem to always change size when transfered, in either
binary or text mode.  So it would be best to set get_size_change=false
.SH NETIQUETTE
If you are going to mirror a remote site, please obey any restrictions
that the site administrators place on access.  You can generally find
the restrictions on connecting to the archive using the standard \fBftp\fP
command.  Any restrictions are normally given as a login banner or in
a (hopefully) obvious file.
.LP
Here are, what I hope are, some good general rules:
.LP
Only mirror a site well outside the working hours of both the local
and remote sites.
.LP
It is probably unfriendly to try to mirror a remote site more
than once a day.
.LP
Before trying to mirror a remote site, try and find the packages you
want from local archives, as no one will be pleased if you soak up a
lot of network bandwidth needlessly.
.LP
If you have a local archive, then tell people about it so they don't
have to waste bandwidth and CPU at the remote site.
.LP
Do remember to check your config-files from time to time in case the
remote archive has changed their access restrictions.
.LP
Check the remote site regularly for any new restrictions.
.SH SEE ALSO
perl(l), ftp(1), mm(1)
.SH BUGS
.LP
Some of the netiquette guidelines should be enforced.
.LP
Should be able to cope with links as well as symlinks.
.LP
Suffers from \fIcreeping featurism\fP.
.SH REMEMBER
.LP
Objects in a mirror are closer than you think!
