# S.L.Freeland - 30-November-1999
# This file provides implied/automatic linkages for branches
# If instrument/branch in the 1st column is referenced, the 
# instruments/branches in the second...NN columns are included 
# Generally, the PI team suggest auto-linkages
#
# These are in addition to the 'forced' linkages 
# (such as ssw-gen, mission-gen, and mission-ucon) which are required to 
#  assure integrated function)
#  10-oct-2006 - S.L.Freeland - add SBROWSER->SECCHI links
#  22-jan-2008 - S.L.Freeland - add NRL->SECCHI & LASCO
