Description of $ys/idlfix		February 23, 1993 - S.L.Freeland

$ys/idlfix directory was created to contain source code which falls under
one of the following categories...

1. IDL supplied source code contains a bug in 'current' version - If a
   corrected version is available, it is placed in directory:
	$ys/idlfix/soft/bugfix
   These routines will precede the idl supplied (incorrect) version in !path
   to provide a temporary work around to the problem.

2. A new IDL feature is incorporated in $ys software but is not available
   to users of older versions.  If a dummy version of such a routine can
   be written to emulate (or at least mask) the new routine, it is placed
   in directory:
	$ys/idlfix/soft/oldxyz (where xyz = rev. when new feature was
				introduced, ex: old220 = !version.rev=.2.2.0)

   The routine: set_oldpath.pro will add the category 2. direrectories to
   !path selectivly, based upon the current IDL version running at startup.

If routines falling into category 1. are fixed in later revs of idl, then
they will be moved into a 'category 2. type' directory.
