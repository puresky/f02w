Just run the script workspace_initialize, it will initialize the whole scripts work space for you.
--to be done:
Of course, it will solicit your conformation before it implements something.

If want scripts usable,
    just type "bash workspace_initialize ~/scripts";
or updated, 
    just type the command above once again.
